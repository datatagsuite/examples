The Study consists of interviews with both mothers and fathers at birth and again when children are ages one, three and five, plus in-home assessments of children and their home environments at ages three and five. The study was designed to primarily address the following questions: (1) What are the conditions and capabilities of unmarried parents, especially fathers?; (2) What is the nature of the relationships between unmarried parents?; (3) How do children born into these families fare?; and (4) How do policies and environmental conditions affect families and children?",

The CHART New York Smoking-Cessation Interventions for Urban Hospital Patients trial looked at the effectiveness of a pro-active, multi-session telephone counseling program with motivational enhancement as compared to the New York State Quitline. Data was collected from a randomized trial aimed at comparing effectiveness of two approaches of smoking cessation interventions. A total of 1618 adult smokers were enrolled from Bellevue Hospital and the Manhattan VA. The data examines smoking abstinence at baseline, and two-, six-month follow up periods. Measures include socio-demographics, smoking history, health habits, health status, depression, biochemical validation, participant satisfaction and intervention fidelity.",

The dataset also includes survey data administered  before and after the study to evaluate the feasibility of using GPS devices for this kind of research, as well as participants' adherence to the GPS study protocol. Finally, the dataset includes GPS data points from study participants. Data also includes objective and subjective neighborhood characteristics (e.g. perceived neighborhood-level social norms about sex and drugs).",

The data tracked includes pre-operative risk factors, intra-procedural variables, post-procedural outcomes, and instances of long-term follow-up. The NYU branch of the initiative, specifically, collects data on carotid artery stenting, carotid endarterectomy, endovascular and open aortic aneurysm repair, hemodialysis access creation, inferior vena cava filter deployment and retrieval, supra-inguinal and infra-inguinal lower extremity bypass, peripheral vascular intervention, thoracic and juxta-renal endovascular aneurysm repair, and varicose vein excision and\/or ablation. The registry can also be leveraged to produce risk-adjusted comparisons and benchmark reports contrasting NYU Langone\u2019s results with those of either our regional group (greater NY), or national PSO.",

Measurements included traditional risk factors such as blood pressure and lipids as well as measures of subclinical disease, including echocardiography of the heart, carotid ultrasound, and cranial magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI). At six month intervals between clinic visits, and once clinic visits ended, participants were contacted by phone to ascertain hospitalizations and health status. The main outcomes are coronary heart disease (CHD), angina, heart failure (HF), stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), claudication, and mortality. Participants continue to be followed for these events.",

The project uses a community-engaged and community venue-based approach to assess existing health issues, available resources, and best approaches to meet community health needs. There are currently two rounds of CHRNAs, one undertaken in 2004-2006 and the other undertaken in 2013-2016 in order to assess population changes, population health improvements, and changes in risk and protective factors in the last decade. For both rounds, approximately 100 individuals were surveyed from each Asian subgroup. Round 1 include Cambodians, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, South Asians, Thai, and Vietnamese (n=1,201). Round 2 includes Arab, Asian Indian, Bangladeshi, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Himalayan, Indo-Caribbean, Japanese, Korean, Pakistani, Ski Lankan, and Vietnamese (n=1,803). Data collection remains in process for Round 2.",

            "description": "Project RICE was a five-year, community-driven initiative to promote diabetes prevention among Korean and South Asian American immigrants at risk for diabetes in New York City using a community health worker (CHW) model approach. Project RICE consisted of two phases, a descriptive study completed in 2010 that informed the design of the pilot intervention and the intervention itself. The descriptive study consisted of surveys, health screenings, and needs assessment surveys that were administered in Korean (n=284) and South Asian (n=305) communities at community health fairs in order to characterize community members' general health needs, access to services, lifestyle behaviors, and perceptions of disease as related to diabetes prevention and health promotion. Focus groups were also lead by CHWs and conducted with Korean and South Asian immigrant communities. The CHW intervention utilized a randomized controlled design. The eligible participants were Korean and South Asian immigrants between 18 and 75 years of age, identified as at risk for diabetes by a risk assessment, and willing to be randomizing into a treatment or control group. The pilot intervention was completed in 2012 and included a total of 145 Asian Indian and 48 Korean individuals. The full intervention took place between 2012 and 2014, and total of 310 Korean individuals were consented into the full intervention. The intervention lasted 6-months, and the data was collected at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months.",

Data collected on home health patients and hospice discharges include age, sex, race, ethnicity, services received, length of time since admission, diagnoses, medications taken, advance directive, and more. Surveys have been conducted in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2007, but data is only available online from 1996 forward. Sample design varies by year, and the survey was redesigned and expanded for 2007.

The second survey was conducted in  the summer of 2016 on a new group of participants. 1048 people were surveyed between 18 and 40 years of age. During both rounds of data collection, those surveyed were asked about their age, sex, race, ethnicity, level of educational attainment, sexual orientation, parental educational attainment, weekly income, religiosity, frequency of attending nightclubs or festivals, lifetime use of more than 100 isolated NPSs, and lifetime use of traditional drugs.",

Microbiota and metabolomics profiling was performed on lyophilized feces from 42 colorectal cancer cases and 89 matched controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify statistically independent associations with CRC. First principal coordinate-component pair (PCo1-PC1) and false discovery rate (0.05)-corrected P-values were calculated for 116,000 Pearson correlations between 530 metabolites and 220 microbes in a sex*case\/control meta-analysis. The dataset includes information on metabolites most strongly correlated with CRC-associated taxa by case-control status, and logistic regression association with CRC for the 72 metabolite-microbial taxon pairs that were correlated with each other at false discovery rate 0.05.",

The surveys are conducted by telephone, and data have been collected in 1988, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2011, 2014, and 2016. The 2014 and 2016 waves of data collection include state-level information, including information about state Medicaid programs, state insurance commission, and resources to support health reform implementation. The earlier surveys include information on (1) treatment practices; (2) patient characteristics like race, ethnicity, employment status, and patient age; (3) program characteristics like program ownership (whether it is a public, private for-profit, or private non-profit institutions) and accreditation; and (4) managerial and staff attitudes towards treatment best practices, harm reduction, and abstinence. Substance abuse treatment programs are chosen for the study by random selection from a list of all such programs, provided by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Survey response rates range between 82-92%, with little to no evidence of non-response bias. Data from 2014 and 2016 are not yet available.",

Baseline surveys, dietary surveys, and seven follow-up surveys were conducted. Between 1985 and 1991, the NYU Women's Health Study enrolled 14,274 women at the Guttman Breast Diagnostic Institute in New York City for a study of endogenous hormones, diet, and risk of breast cancer. Blood samples are used to explore biological differences between women who develop disease and women who remain disease-free. Since its inception in 1985, the study has been expanded to include exposures other than diet and hormones in relation to cancer as well as other diseases like cardiovascular disease and osteoporotic fractures. Follow-up questionnaires are conducted periodically to update information on their health conditions and lifestyle. Follow-up is supplemented by periodic linkages to tumor registries and to the National Death Index.",

Most of the study subjects were without medical insurance until they became eligible for health benefits through their union. The attendants were interviewed at the point of union enrollment, and again nine months later to assess changes in health status and health services utilization. During the pre-program survey, respondents were queried about concerns over health, recent injuring, self-assessed health, extent and type of previous health coverage, limitations of daily functioning due to poor health, and recent health care utilization. The post-program survey included questions about out-of-pocket expenses, type of health services received, and questions about health care utilization that were specific to the New York City area. Additional variables in the data collection include respondent's race, Hispanic origin, place of birth, past work experience, date of birth, and sex, plus the sex and dates of birth of family members. A total of 475 attendants were interviewed for the pre-program, and follow-up interviews were obtained from 360 of the 475 sample members.",

UHI is a long-term effort to improve the health, safety, and well-being of children and youth in five economically distressed cities in the United States: Baltimore, MD, Detroit, MI, Oakland, CA, Philadelphia, PA, and Richmond, VA. The UHI Survey of Adults and Youth (SAY) included a variety of questions, asked of both parents and their 10-18 year old children, regarding children's health, safety, perceptions of neighborhoods and schools, family relations, quality of city services, and other issues. SAY surveyed 3 types of households -- households without children, households with children aged 0-9 years, and households with children aged 10-18 years -- in up to 14 geographic areas, including the 5 UHI program cities, 9 comparison cities demographically similar to the UHI cities, the suburban regions of these cities, the most populous 100 United States cities, and the rest of the country. There were 3 waves of SAY fielded during the course of the UHI project: during the 1998-1999, 2001-2002, and 2004-2005 school years. There is a separate data file for each wave, and each record contains all of the data for a given household.",

The goal of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel, multicomponent, evidence-based intervention compared with usual care in improving blood pressure control among hypertensive blacks who receive care in community health centers. 30 community health centers were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=15) or the usual care group (n=15). A total of 1,056 patients were enrolled in CAATCH, and patients completed face-to-face interviews with and had their blood pressure measured at baseline, six, and twelve months. Variables collected include changes in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 months as well as change in physical activity, perfect change in weight, change in the number of daily servings of fruits and vegetables, and the proportion of participants with adequate blood pressure control at 12 months.",

The study evaluated the effectiveness of a culturally and linguistically tailored telephone-delivered intervention to promote adherence to physician-recommended sleep apnea assessment and treatment among blacks with metabolic syndrome. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. Participants in the intervention arm received 10 phone calls to address the challenges and barriers to recommended care for sleep apnea. Sociodemographic variables, including age, type of health insurance, marital status, education, place of birth, years in current residence and locality, number of children and adults living in the household, self-described ethnicity, and annual household income were collected. An Apnea-risk evaluation system questionnaire was used to collect information on sleep patterns, daytime functioning, knowledge of sleep apnea, and diseases associated with sleep apnea. Other questionnaires collected information on knowledge of and belief in sleep apnea as well as a 32-item instrument used to assess a person's readiness to change their behaviors. Further variables were collected on medical history including a history of sleep disorders, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other health behaviors.",

Data were collected in five public housing developments which were selected due to a high chronic disease burden. Data were first collected via random telephone survey of 1,633 individuals. This data informed a later interventional study, which included 370 individuals, 199 in the intervention group and 176 in the comparison group. The intervention consisted of community health workers and health advocates working in public housing. Variables collected throughout include age, gender, race\/ethnicity, employment status, health insurance, self-reported general health, self-reported mental health, level of physical activity, smoker status, DMI, blood pressure, level of social connectedness, and specific health conditions including asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and depression.",

Variables collected include information on demographics, physical and mental health conditions, health insurance, levels of physical activity, social connectedness, chronic disease, obesity, smoking, falls and other accidents, food stamp use, community service use, and levels of food insecurity.",

The researcher will then be notified if they are approved. Next, IRB review and approval must be submitted to NYC-CDRN.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>Once the above process is complete, a request for data can be made. Use of data is subject to the signing of a data use agreement and other necessary contracts.

The study was designed to determine whether a city-mandated policy requiring calorie labeling at fast food restaurants was associated with consumer awareness of labels, calories purchased, and number of fast food restaurant visits. Data was collected in Philadelphia before and after calorie labeling was implemented and in Baltimore, where calorie labeling was not implemented. Baseline collected took place in December 2009 in both Baltimore and Philadelphia. Data was collected after calorie labeling took effect in Philadelphia in February 2010. Further follow-up data collection occurred in June 2010. Researchers collected data on whether or not consumers reported seeing calorie labeling in the restaurant, whether they bought fewer or more calories as a result of the labeling, and how frequently they went to fast food restaurants. They also collected data on consumer age, gender, race, education, income, and BMI category.",

Data was collected via street-intercept survey and follow-up 24 hour recall over the telephone. Data was collected on the habits of children through their parents\/caregivers. Data was in 2011 in three waves, in Morrisania before the supermarket opened, in Morrisania after the supermarket opened, and in Highbridge. Data collected included demographic information like gender, age, race\/ethnicity, household income, education, marital status, household size, and employment. Researchers also collected information on where participants typically shopped for food, how far they travelled to their usual store, whether participants had heard of a new store opening in their neighborhood, household food availability of selected healthful and unhealthful foods, and food consumption habits. A total of 2230 surveys were collected.",

Cafeteria managers were interviewed about their experiences with the water jets, implementation and maintenance of the water jets, and student interaction with the jets. Students were surveyed with 26 multiple choice questions about their food shopping behavior, key demographic characteristics, and opinions and beliefs about water consumption. Data was collected at intervention and comparison schools at three points: pre-intervention\/baseline in November 2010, 3.5 months after installation in March 2011, and 10 months post-intervention September 2011 after the beginning of the new school year.",

The bodegas were chosen based on their proximity to elementary schools that were participating in a school wellness intervention through Bronx Health REACH (BHR), a community-based coalition that is part of the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) program. BHR focuses on reducing racial and ethnic disparities in diabetes outcomes in the Bronx. Surveys were administered in English and Spanish to adult bodega shoppers in 2012, and consumers received a round-trip NYC MetroCard (valued at $4.50) in exchange for their participation. The survey consisted of 26 multiple choice questions about the participants' food shopping behaviors and demographic characteristics. A total of 779 surveys were collected.",

It was conducted as part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rnworkproject.org\/\" target-\"_blank\">RN Work Project<\/a>, a national study of new nurses funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The first wave of the survey took place in 2006. It asked nurses about their jobs, turnover, intentions and attitudes--including intent, satisfaction, organizational commitment, and preferences about work.<\/p> <p>The second wave of the survey took place in 2008. It covered topics about quality improvement including patient-centered care, evidence-based practice, standardized practices for restrain and seclusion, infection control, pain management, use of information technology or strategies to reduce reliance on memory, participation in analyzing errors and designing system improvements, use of national patient safety resources, and use of specific quality improvement models. The survey was administered as a mail questionnaire, and wave 1 respondents were selected using a random stratified cluster design. Codebook and survey instruments are also available on ICPSR<\/p>",

In separate analyses, researchers compared risk factors in early (age <50) vs. late onset (age \u226550) CRC as well as risk factors in early onset CRC patients vs. age-matched controls without cancer. The comparison with healthy controls is intended to help identify modifiable risk factors that may be targets for behavioral intervention as well as non-modifiable risk factors that may be indications for earlier screening. Data was compiled on approximatley 4,300 patients, including patients between 18-49 years old diagnosed with CRC (200 patients), patients between 50-90 years old diagnosed with CRC (3300 patients), and health controls with the same year of birth as patients in Group 1 without CRC (800 patients).",
