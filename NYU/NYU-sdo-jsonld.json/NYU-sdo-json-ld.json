"description": "The Consortium of Hospitals Advancing Research on Tobacco (CHART) is a network of six projects and a coordinating center aimed at assessing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions initiated during hospitalizations and continued post-discharge. The CHART New York Smoking-Cessation Interventions for Urban Hospital Patients trial looked at the effectiveness of a pro-active, multi-session telephone counseling program with motivational enhancement as compared to the New York State Quitline. Data was collected from a randomized trial aimed at comparing effectiveness of two approaches of smoking cessation interventions. A total of 1618 adult smokers were enrolled from Bellevue Hospital and the Manhattan VA. The data examines smoking abstinence at baseline, and two-, six-month follow up periods. Measures include socio-demographics, smoking history, health habits, health status, depression, biochemical validation, participant satisfaction and intervention fidelity.",
